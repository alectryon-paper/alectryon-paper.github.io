|Coq| Integrated Development Environment
========================================

The Coq Integrated Development Environment is a graphical tool, to be
used as a user-friendly replacement to `coqtop`. Its main purpose is to
allow the user to navigate forward and backward into a Coq vernacular
file, executing corresponding commands or undoing them respectively.

|CoqIDE| is run by typing the command `coqide` on the command line.
Without argument, the main screen is displayed with an “unnamed
buffer”, and with a filename as argument, another buffer displaying
the contents of that file. Additionally, `coqide` accepts the same
options as `coqtop`, given in :ref:`thecoqcommands`, the ones having obviously
no meaning for |CoqIDE| being ignored.

.. _coqide_mainscreen:

A sample |CoqIDE| main screen, while navigating into a file `Fermat.v`,
is shown in the figure :ref:`CoqIDE main screen <coqide_mainscreen>`.
At the top is a menu bar, and a tool bar
below it. The large window on the left is displaying the various
*script buffers*. The upper right window is the *goal window*, where
goals to be proven are displayed. The lower right window is the *message
window*, where various messages resulting from commands are displayed.
At the bottom is the status bar.

Managing files and buffers, basic editing
----------------------------------------------

In the script window, you may open arbitrarily many buffers to edit.
The *File* menu allows you to open files or create some, save them,
print or export them into various formats. Among all these buffers,
there is always one which is the current *running buffer*, whose name
is displayed on a background in the *processed* color (green by default), which
is the one where Coq commands are currently executed.

Buffers may be edited as in any text editor, and classical basic
editing commands (Copy/Paste, …) are available in the *Edit* menu.
|CoqIDE| offers only basic editing commands, so if you need more complex
editing commands, you may launch your favorite text editor on the
current buffer, using the *Edit/External Editor* menu.

Interactive navigation into Coq scripts
--------------------------------------------

The running buffer is the one where navigation takes place. The toolbar offers
five basic commands for this. The first one, represented by a down arrow icon,
is for going forward executing one command. If that command is successful, the
part of the script that has been executed is displayed on a background with the
processed color. If that command fails, the error message is displayed in the
message window, and the location of the error is emphasized by an underline in
the error foreground color (red by default).

In the figure :ref:`CoqIDE main screen <coqide_mainscreen>`,
the running buffer is `Fermat.v`, all commands until
the ``Theorem`` have been already executed, and the user tried to go
forward executing ``Induction n``. That command failed because no such
tactic exists (names of standard tactics are written in lowercase),
and the failing command is underlined.

Notice that the processed part of the running buffer is not editable. If
you ever want to modify something you have to go backward using the up
arrow tool, or even better, put the cursor where you want to go back
and use the goto button. Unlike with `coqtop`, you should never use
``Undo`` to go backward.

There are two additional buttons for navigation within the running buffer. The
"down" button with a line goes directly to the end; the "up" button with a line
goes back to the beginning. The handling of errors when using the go-to-the-end
button depends on whether |Coq| is running in asynchronous mode or not (see
Chapter :ref:`asynchronousandparallelproofprocessing`). If it is not running in that mode, execution
stops as soon as an error is found. Otherwise, execution continues, and the
error is marked with an underline in the error foreground color, with a
background in the error background color (pink by default). The same
characterization of error-handling applies when running several commands using
the "goto" button.

If you ever try to execute a command that runs for a long time
and would like to abort it before it terminates, you may
use the interrupt button (the white cross on a red circle).

There are other buttons on the |CoqIDE| toolbar: a button to save the running
buffer; a button to close the current buffer (an "X"); buttons to switch among
buffers (left and right arrows); an "information" button; and a "gears" button.

The "gears" button submits proof terms to the |Coq| kernel for type checking.
When |Coq| uses asynchronous processing (see Chapter :ref:`asynchronousandparallelproofprocessing`),
proofs may have been completed without kernel-checking of generated proof terms.
The presence of unchecked proof terms is indicated by ``Qed`` statements that
have a subdued *being-processed* color (light blue by default), rather than the
processed color, though their preceding proofs have the processed color.

Notice that for all these buttons, except for the "gears" button, their operations
are also available in the menu, where their keyboard shortcuts are given.

Proof folding
------------------

As your script grows bigger and bigger, it might be useful to hide the
proofs of your theorems and lemmas.

This feature is toggled via the Hide entry of the Navigation menu. The
proof shall be enclosed between ``Proof.`` and ``Qed.``, both with their final
dots. The proof that shall be hidden or revealed is the first one
whose beginning statement (such as ``Theorem``) precedes the insertion
cursor.


Vernacular commands, templates
-----------------------------------

The Templates menu allows using shortcuts to insert vernacular
commands. This is a nice way to proceed if you are not sure of the
syntax of the command you want.

Moreover, from this menu you can automatically insert templates of complex
commands like ``Fixpoint`` that you can conveniently fill afterwards.

Queries
------------

.. image:: ../_static/coqide-queries.png
   :alt: |CoqIDE| queries

We call *query* any vernacular command that does not change the current state,
such as ``Check``, ``Search``, etc. To run such commands interactively, without
writing them in scripts, |CoqIDE| offers a *query pane*. The query pane can be
displayed on demand by using the ``View`` menu, or using the shortcut ``F1``.
Queries can also be performed by selecting a particular phrase, then choosing an
item from the ``Queries`` menu. The response then appears in the message window.
The image above shows the result after selecting of the phrase
``Nat.mul`` in the script window, and choosing ``Print`` from the ``Queries``
menu.


Compilation
----------------

The `Compile` menu offers direct commands to:

+ compile the current buffer
+ run a compilation using `make`
+ go to the last compilation error
+ create a `Makefile` using `coq_makefile`.

Customizations
-------------------

You may customize your environment using the menu Edit/Preferences. A new
window will be displayed, with several customization sections
presented as a notebook.

The first section is for selecting the text font used for scripts,
goal and message windows.

The second and third sections are for controlling colors and style.

The fourth section is for customizing the editor. It includes in
particular the ability to activate an Emacs mode named
micro-Proof-General (use the Help menu to know more about the
available bindings).

The next section is devoted to file management: you may configure
automatic saving of files, by periodically saving the contents into
files named `#f#` for each opened file `f`. You may also activate the
*revert* feature: in case a opened file is modified on the disk by a
third party, |CoqIDE| may read it again for you. Note that in the case
you edited that same file, you will be prompted to choose to either
discard your changes or not. The File charset encoding choice is
described below in :ref:`character-encoding-saved-files`.

The `Externals` section allows customizing the external commands for
compilation, printing, web browsing. In the browser command, you may
use `%s` to denote the URL to open, for example:
`firefox -remote "OpenURL(%s)"`.

Notice that these settings are saved in the file `.coqiderc` of your
home directory.

A Gtk2 accelerator keymap is saved under the name `.coqide.keys`. It
is not recommended to edit this file manually: to modify a given menu
shortcut, go to the corresponding menu item without releasing the
mouse button, press the key you want for the new shortcut, and release
the mouse button afterwards. If your system does not allow it, you may
still edit this configuration file by hand, but this is more involved.


Using Unicode symbols
--------------------------

|CoqIDE| is based on GTK+ and inherits from it support for Unicode in
its text windows. Consequently a large set of symbols is available for
notations. Furthermore, |CoqIDE| conveniently provides a simple way to
input Unicode characters.


Displaying Unicode symbols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You just need to define suitable notations as described in the chapter
:ref:`syntaxextensionsandinterpretationscopes`. For example, to use the
mathematical symbols ∀ and ∃, you may define:

.. coqtop:: in

   Notation "∀ x .. y , P" := (forall x, .. (forall y, P) ..)
     (at level 200, x binder, y binder, right associativity)
     : type_scope.
   Notation "∃ x .. y , P" := (exists x, .. (exists y, P) ..)
     (at level 200, x binder, y binder, right associativity)
     : type_scope.

There exists a small set of such notations already defined, in the
file `utf8.v` of Coq library, so you may enable them just by
``Require Import Unicode.Utf8`` inside |CoqIDE|, or equivalently,
by starting |CoqIDE| with ``coqide -l utf8``.

However, there are some issues when using such Unicode symbols: you of
course need to use a character font which supports them. In the Fonts
section of the preferences, the Preview line displays some Unicode
symbols, so you could figure out if the selected font is OK. Related
to this, one thing you may need to do is choosing whether GTK+ should
use antialiased fonts or not, by setting the environment variable
`GDK_USE_XFT` to 1 or 0 respectively.


.. _coqide-unicode:

Bindings for input of Unicode symbols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CoqIDE supports a builtin mechanism to input non-ASCII symbols.
For example, to input ``π``, it suffices to type ``\pi`` then press the
combination of key ``Shift+Space`` (default key binding). Often, it
suffices to type a prefix of the latex token, e.g. typing ``\p``
then ``Shift+Space`` suffices to insert a ``π``.

For several symbols, ASCII art is also recognized, e.g. ``\->`` for a
right arrow, or ``\>=`` for a greater than or equal sign.

A larger number of latex tokens are supported by default. The full list
is available here:
https://github.com/coq/coq/blob/master/ide/default_bindings_src.ml

Custom bindings may be added, as explained further on.

.. note::

    It remains possible to input non-ASCII symbols using system-wide
    approaches independent of |CoqIDE|.


Adding custom bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To extend the default set of bindings, create a file named ``coqide.bindings``
and place it in the same folder as ``coqide.keys``. On Linux, this would be
the folder ``~/.config/coq``. The file `coqide.bindings` should contain one
binding per line, in the form ``\key value``, followed by an optional priority
integer. (The key and value should not contain any space character.)

.. example::

   Here is an example configuration file:

   ::

     \par ||
     \pi π 1
     \le ≤ 1
     \lambda λ 2
     \lambdas λs

Above, the priority number 1 on ``\pi`` indicates that the prefix ``\p``
should resolve to ``\pi``, and not to something else (e.g. ``\par``).
Similarly, the above settings ensure than ``\l`` resolves to ``\le``,
and that ``\la`` resolves to ``\lambda``.

It can be useful to work with per-project binding files. For this purpose
|CoqIDE| accepts a command line argument of the form
``-unicode-bindings file1,file2,...,fileN``.
Each of the file tokens provided may consists of one of:

 -  a path to a custom bindings file,
 -  the token ``default``, which resolves to the default bindings file,
 -  the token ``local``, which resolves to the `coqide.bindings` file
    stored in the user configuration directory.

.. warning::

   If a filename other than the first one includes a "~" to refer
   to the home directory, it won't be expanded properly. To work around that
   issue, one should not use comas but instead repeat the flag, in the form:
   ``-unicode-bindings file1 .. -unicode-bindings fileN``.

.. note::

   If two bindings for a same token both have the same priority value
   (or both have no priority value set), then the binding considered is
   the one from the file that comes first on the command line.


.. _character-encoding-saved-files:

Character encoding for saved files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Files section of the preferences, the encoding option is
related to the way files are saved.

If you have no need to exchange files with non UTF-8 aware
applications, it is better to choose the UTF-8 encoding, since it
guarantees that your files will be read again without problems. (This
is because when |CoqIDE| reads a file, it tries to automatically detect
its character encoding.)

If you choose something else than UTF-8, then missing characters will
be written encoded by `\x{....}` or `\x{........}` where each dot is
an hexadecimal digit: the number between braces is the hexadecimal
Unicode index for the missing character.
